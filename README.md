We use lerna for code-splitting, learn more [here](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

### transmute-framework

The transmute framework is a library for connecting off-chain data with on-chain smart contracts. Like ORM middleware for dapps. 

This implementation is not optimized for cost, but for rapid prototyping. The framework is meant for developing proof of concepts quickly, and not currently ready for production use.

### transmute-minikube

Kubernetes help us run networked services like IPFS and Ethereum in an extenable manner. It also allows us to use helm charts to represent dapps. We provide tutorials and travis configs for using minikube for dapp development. 

### transmute-crypto

A wrapper around common cryptographic needs, such as Event Encryption, libsodium and wallets. NOT AUDITED YET.

### transmute-contracts

Transmute solidity contracts and a simple truffle setup.

### transmute-adapters

Adapters are simple middleware used by the framework to store objects. Encryption should be used before saving objects to adapters.


### Setup Local Dev Env
* [Setup Minikube](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube)
* [Setup IPFS](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube/ipfs)
* [Setup Ganache-CLI]

```
lerna bootstrap
lerna run --scope transmute-contracts contracts:migrate:ganache
lerna run --scope transmute-framework contracts:generate
lerna run --scope transmute-crypto build
lerna run --scope transmute-framework test
lerna run --scope transmute-framework build
```


<!-- 
### Recommended Setup

#### Note: Use npm with this project, yarn does not play nicely with lerna setup.

We provide test infrastructure to run the project, without the need to run a local testnet or ipfs and deploy contracts:

```
npm install -g lerna
git clone https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute.git
lerna bootstrap
lerna run build --ignore transmute-contracts --ignore transmute-framework --ignore transmute-alpha
lerna run build --scope transmute-framework
```

#### Advanced Setup

If you wish to run everything locally, you can use this minikube setup:

* [Setup Minikube](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube)
* [Setup IPFS](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube/ipfs)
* [Setup Ganache-CLI](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube/ganache-cli)

When using minikube, before running scripts, you will want to export these env vars:

```
export GANACHE_CLI=$(minikube --namespace transmute-testrpc  service transmute-testrpc-ganache-cli --url )
export IPFS_GATEWAY=$(minikube service --url ipfs-gateway --namespace transmute-ipfs)
export IPFS_API=$(minikube service --url ipfs-api --namespace transmute-ipfs)
```

### Compliance Demo

Many compliance use cases involve linking off-chain data to on-chain smart contracts, which can provide an immutable audit log. Such transactions are expensive, but with the transmute framework some cost can be saved through off chain storage, via a hopefully familar redux interface.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to write events to ethereum smart contracts, and how ReadModels represent the state of a smart contract as it processes each event. ReadModels can be saved to databases and queried over time, and are an interface for off chain services.

You'll learn:

* How to create an eventstore contract.
* How to save an event with an adapter.
* How to use a ReadModel to get a smart contracts state.

To get started, navigate to the `transmute-compliance-demo` directory.

```
cd packages/transmute-compliance-demo
```
